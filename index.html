    <h2> Who We Are </h2>
      <p> <strong> E.Motion is the K-pop dance group at Cornell University. </strong> We seek to share enjoyment in Korean pop music and dance performances to the Cornell community. We've performed in various on campus events such as the CTAS Night Market, CSA Midnight Dimsum, Taste Around the World, Cornell Dancers Alliance, etc. We also post various dance covers on Youtube. Dancers of all levels are welcome to join and dance with us! </p>

    <h2> Missions and Values </h2>
      <h3> Mission </h3>
        <p> Our mission is to instill a great love of dance, while inspiring self-confidence, discipline and respect of the performing arts in K-pop. We provide a solid technical foundation for a dancer while also building community on campus. </p>
      <h3> Values </h3>
        <p> E.Motion values the Cornell and Ithaca community and we support students throughout campus. It is through community building with diverse individuals from all backgrounds that we can teach (and learn) the value of dance and human kindness. </p>
