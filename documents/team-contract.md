# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
  - Each person contributes approximately 9 hours a week to this project, making the work equal
  - Everyone should contribute to design journey and coding
  - We will all work cooperatively to create a cohesive website that the client is satisfied with



2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
  - Pushing no later than the morning of the due date for each milestone.
  - Let each other know when are working on the project through our Facebook groupchat
  - Respond within 24 hours to each message



3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
  - Meet once a week on Sundays at 2PM
  - Each time a member is working on a project (almost every day), we will communicate with each other.



4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
  - Communication is established through texting and in person meetings, phone calls if necessary
  - We will meet once a week with our client



5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
 - Client First Point: this person is the client’s first point of contact to schedule meetings and communicate last minute changes or addendums, the client knows to reach out first to this person.
 - Each page will be assigned to one person, and other members will jump around to help each other as needed



6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?
 - What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised? To hold each other accountable, we will discuss accountability every week during our meetings. We will have weekly goals and deliverables due by the following meeting. Major revisions will be made during our work sessions to make sure everyone is doing similar work.
 - We will say “Hello (insert name here), it appears that you have not been contributing equally. Is there a reason why and how can we better support you?”
 - To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised, we will say “Hello (insert name), it appears that you have failed to complete your deliverables. Is there a reason why and when it the next best deadline for you to achieve your goals?”



7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
 - We tell each other, discuss, and if we do not reach consensus, vote and everyone should support that result for the team.
 - If it’s a disagreement on design, we would discuss with the clients and let the client choose which one is better.



8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
  - Every week during our work sessions on Sunday, we will ask ourselves if there is anything we would like to change. If so, we will discuss and revisit accordingly. 


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
  - After we finish our project 4, we will get celebratory bubble tea at UTEA.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
